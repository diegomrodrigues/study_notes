## Hypotheses

The core hypothesis of this project is:

Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, specifically LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), is a viable, sufficient, and efficient method to achieve the same tool use and chain-of-thought behaviors observed in models trained with advanced reinforcement learning techniques.

## Data

We will use the following datasets for evaluation:

1. GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K) dataset for mathematical reasoning tasks.
2. MATH Para medir a generalização
3. HumanEval dataset for code generation and tool use evaluation.

These datasets cover a range of tasks that require both tool use and chain-of-thought reasoning, allowing us to comprehensively evaluate our hypothesis.

## Metrics

We will use the following metrics for evaluation:

1. Accuracy: The percentage of correct answers across all tasks.
2. BLEU score: To evaluate the quality of generated text in chain-of-thought reasoning.
3. Pass@k: For code generation tasks in HumanEval, measuring the percentage of problems solved with k generations.
4. Inference time: To measure the computational efficiency of the fine-tuned models.
5. Memory Used: To measure the memory efficiency of the fine-tunned models.

## Models

We will use the following models in our experiment:

### Baselines:
1. LLaMA 2 Instruct (7B)
2. Gemma 2 (2B version) google/gemma-2-2b-it
3. LLaMA 3.2 (3B version)

These baseline models will be used in their pre-trained form without any fine-tuning.

### Experimental models:
We will fine-tune each of the baseline models using LoRA with varying parameters:
- Rank: [4, 16]
- Alpha: [16, 32]

This will result in 4 fine-tuned models for each baseline model, allowing us to explore the impact of different LoRA configurations.

## General Reasoning

Our experiment aims to determine whether PEFT (LoRA) fine-tuning can achieve comparable performance to models trained with advanced reinforcement learning techniques in terms of tool use and chain-of-thought behaviors. By using a diverse set of datasets and metrics, we will evaluate the models' performance across various tasks that require these capabilities.

We hypothesize that LoRA fine-tuning, being more computationally efficient and requiring fewer resources, can produce models that exhibit similar tool use and reasoning behaviors to those trained with more complex techniques. By comparing the performance of our fine-tuned models against the baseline models and published results of models trained with reinforcement learning, we can assess the viability and efficiency of our approach.

The varying LoRA parameters will allow us to identify optimal configurations for different model sizes and tasks, providing insights into the scalability and flexibility of this fine-tuning method.

## Summary of Progress

### Completed:
1. Literature review on PEFT techniques and LoRA
2. Selection of baseline models and datasets
3. Initial setup of the experimental environment

### To be done:
1. Implementation of LoRA fine-tuning pipeline
2. Fine-tuning of all model variations
3. Evaluation of models on selected datasets
4. Analysis of results and comparison with reinforcement learning-based models
5. Writing up the findings and conclusions

### Potential obstacles:
1. Computational resources for fine-tuning multiple large models
2. Potential licensing issues with some of the baseline models
3. Ensuring fair comparison with reinforcement learning-based models, as their training details may not be fully available

### Next steps:
1. Secure necessary computational resources
2. Finalize the implementation of the LoRA fine-tuning pipeline
3. Begin fine-tuning process with a subset of models to validate the approach
