#### Section 5: Prompt Generation, Evaluation and Control

- 
- **Three-Stage Taxonomy:**  Organizes the surveyed approaches based on the three-stage reasoning pipeline: prompt generation for reasoning steps, evaluation of step results, and control of the reasoning process.
- **Prompt Generation Techniques:**
  - 
  - **Hand-written Prompt:**  Manually crafted prompts designed by researchers to guide LLM reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-thought, Zero-shot CoT).
  - **Prompt using External Knowledge:**  Utilizing external information, such as from other models or datasets, to enhance the prompt (e.g., Self-ask).
  - **Model-Generated Prompt:**  Prompting the LLM itself to study the problem and generate the reasoning prompt (e.g., Auto-chain-of-thought, Complexity-based prompting, Buffer-of-thoughts).
- **Evaluation Techniques:**
  - 
  - **Self-Assessment:**  Evaluation of reasoning steps by the LLM itself (e.g., Self-verification, Self-consistency).
  - **Tool-based Validation:**  Using external tools, like Python interpreters, to evaluate reasoning steps expressed in formal languages (e.g., Codex, Self-debugging, FunSearch, LLaMEA, MathPrompter, Program-of-thoughts, Program-aided-language).
  - **External Model Validation:**  Employing external models, such as robotic affordance models or physics simulators, to validate reasoning steps in specific domains (e.g., Say-can, Inner-monologue).
- **Control Techniques:**
  - 
  - **Greedy Selection:**  Generating and following a single reasoning path without exploring alternatives (e.g., Chain-of-thought, Least-to-most prompting).
  - **Ensemble Strategy:**  Generating multiple reasoning paths, evaluating them, and combining results or selecting the best one (e.g., Self-consistency, Self-verification, Chain-of-experts).
  - **Reinforcement Learning:**  Using reinforcement learning algorithms to control the reasoning process, exploring multiple steps and backtracking to find optimal solutions (e.g., Tree-of-thoughts, Buffer-of-thoughts, Beam-search, Progressive-hint-prompting, Self-refine, ReAct, Reflexion, Voyager).
