- **Hidden Layers:** Introducing intermediate layers between input and output, enabling the learning of nonlinear relationships.
- **Activation Functions (sigmoid, softmax):**  Using sigmoid for binary classification in hidden layers and softmax for multi-class classification at the output layer.
- **Computation Graph:** Representing the network architecture as a directed graph, showing the flow of information between layers.

### 3.2 Designing Neural Networks

- **Activation Functions (tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU):** Exploring various activation functions and their characteristics, including sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, and Leaky ReLU, discussing their ranges, derivatives, and potential issues like vanishing gradients and dead neurons.
- **Network Structure (width vs. depth):** Discussing the tradeoff between wide and deep networks and its impact on model capacity.
- **Shortcut Connections (residual, highway networks):**  Introducing residual and highway networks, which use shortcut connections to address the vanishing gradient problem and improve training of deep networks, including the use of gates in these architectures.
- **Output Layers and Loss Functions (softmax, margin loss):** Discussing different output layers and associated loss functions, including softmax for multi-class classification with negative log-likelihood loss and affine transformations for margin loss.
- **Input Representations (bag-of-words, word embeddings, lookup layers):**  Explaining different ways to represent text inputs, including bag-of-words, word embeddings, and lookup layers, showing how word embeddings can be learned and used in neural networks.

### 3.3 Learning Neural Networks

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**  Using SGD to update network parameters based on the gradient of the loss function.
- **Gradients and Backpropagation:**  Computing gradients of the loss function with respect to network parameters using backpropagation, a key algorithm for training neural networks.
- **Computation Graphs:**  Using computation graphs to represent the network and its operations, enabling automatic differentiation and efficient gradient computation.
- **Automatic Differentiation:**  Leveraging software libraries to automate the computation of gradients on computation graphs.
- **Regularization (weight decay):**  Applying $L_2$ regularization (weight decay) to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weight values.
- **Dropout:**  Introducing dropout as a regularization technique that randomly sets nodes to zero during training, preventing co-adaptation and over-reliance on single features.
- **Feature Noising:** Mentioning feature noising as a general technique that includes dropout, and can involve adding noise to input or hidden units.
- **Learning Theory (convexity, local optima, saddle points):**  Discussing the non-convexity of neural network objective functions and the implications for finding optimal solutions, including the prevalence of saddle points in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Generalization Guarantees:**  Briefly touching upon the theoretical challenges of understanding how neural networks generalize to unseen data, despite their capacity to memorize training data.
- **Training Tricks (initialization, gradient clipping, batch/layer normalization):**  Presenting practical tricks for effective training, including weight initialization strategies, gradient clipping, batch normalization, and layer normalization, explaining their motivations and effects on training dynamics.
- **Online Optimization (AdaGrad, AdaDelta, Adam, early stopping):** Discussing advanced online optimization algorithms like AdaGrad, AdaDelta, and Adam, and their use of adaptive learning rates. Also mentioning early stopping as a technique to prevent overfitting.

### 3.4 Convolutional Neural Networks

- **Convolutional Layers:**  Introducing convolutional layers for processing sequential input, applying filters to extract local features.
- **Filters and Feature Maps:**  Explaining how filters are applied to the input and how they produce feature maps that capture local patterns.
- **Wide vs. Narrow Convolution:**  Distinguishing between wide and narrow convolution based on padding of the input.
- **Pooling (max-pooling, average-pooling):**  Using pooling operations (max-pooling or average-pooling) to aggregate information from feature maps and create fixed-length representations.
- **Multi-Layer Convolutional Networks:**  Stacking multiple convolutional layers to learn hierarchical representations.
- **Dilated Convolution and Multiscale Representations:**  Introducing dilated convolution as a technique to capture larger context and create multiscale representations.
- **Backpropagation through Max-Pooling:**  Explaining how to compute gradients through the max-pooling operation.
